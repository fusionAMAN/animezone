            <ol type="1">
                <li><strong><i>Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood</i></strong>
                    <p>The struggle of most anime is laying out intricate world-building while balancing a cast of
                        memorable
                        characters, iconic moments, and thrilling fights. And that's what makes Fullmetal Alchemist:
                        Brotherhood
                        so special. The framing device for our entry into this sprawling world is one of sympathy. We
                        understand
                        why the Elric brothers would practice forbidden alchemy in an attempt to resurrect their dead
                        mother
                        at
                        the cost of their physical bodies. And yet despite divine intervention slapping them in the
                        face,
                        telling them no, they continue on their quest. And that quest to resurrect their mother paves
                        the
                        way
                        for motivation that guides them through a world of monsters, government conspiracy, and
                        divinity.
                        And
                        despite all this elegance, FMA: Brotherhood also knows when to lay it all bare in unforgettable
                        moments
                        that will leave you standing in front of your TV cheering for the Elric brothers.</p>
                </li>

                <li><strong><i>Cowboy Bebop:</i></strong></li>
                <p>It's hard to believe Cowboy Bebop is over 20 years old because of how well it still holds up, both in
                    its
                    conception and its execution. The space western that introduced the world to Spike, Jet, Faye, Ed
                    and of
                    course Ein still looks gorgeous, with a resonant story, strong characters and one heck of a
                    soundtrack
                    that
                    ensures it remains one of the best anime ever made. Cowboy Bebop has had an indelible impact that
                    reaches
                    far beyond anime; everyone from Orson Scott Card to Rian Johnson to Robin Williams have praised the
                    series
                    and cited its influence on their work. Cowboy Bebop still works so well because of the continually
                    relatable
                    story at the heart of its genre-bending 26-episode run. Its exploration of adult themes like loss
                    anchors
                    the crew‚Äôs journey throughout the stars, making it a series we‚Äôre happy to revisit even after all
                    this
                    time.
                    Three, two, one, let's jam!</p>
                <img src="image/cowboy-bebop.jpg" alt="cowboy-bebop">
                <li><strong><i>Monster:</i></strong></li>
                <p>Monster is quite simply one of the best stories ever told in anime/manga form, but more than that,
                    it‚Äôs a
                    special anime because of how different it is from everything else. In a medium dominated by giant
                    robots,
                    superpowered heroes that shoot beams out of their hands, and virtual fantasy worlds, Monster is
                    refreshingly
                    grounded in reality. It‚Äôs a dark, mature, gritty thriller about a good man who loses everything
                    after
                    doing
                    what he believed to be the right thing, and the dark descent that he must endure in order to correct
                    his
                    mistake.</p>
                <img src="image/Monster2.jpg" alt="Monster">
                <li><strong><i>One Piece:</i></strong></li>
                <p>There's a reason Eiichiro Oda's One Piece has been going steady since 1999 and spawned all manner of
                    theatrical and TV spinoffs. We just can‚Äôt get enough of the wacky, engrossing saga of stretchable
                    pirate
                    captain Monkey D. Luffy and his ongoing quest to become the next Pirate King. The series is
                    endlessly
                    entertaining, but the characters are what keep you hooked over the course of 900 episodes (and
                    counting)
                </p>
                <img src="image/one-piece.png" alt="One piece">
                <li><strong><i>Bleach:</i></strong></li>
                <p>Bleach (stylized as BLEACH) is a Japanese anime television series based on Tite Kubo's original manga
                    series
                    of the same name. It was produced by Studio Pierrot and directed by Noriyuki Abe. The series aired
                    on TV
                    Tokyo from October 2004 to March 2012, spanning 366 episodes. The story follows the adventures of
                    Ichigo
                    Kurosaki after he obtains the powers of a Soul Reaper‚Äîa death personification similar to the Grim
                    Reaper‚Äîfrom another Soul Reaper, Rukia Kuchiki. His newfound powers force him to take on the duties
                    of
                    defending humans from evil spirits and guiding departed souls to the afterlife. In addition to
                    adapting
                    the
                    manga series it is based on, the anime periodically includes original self-contained storylines and
                    characters not found in the manga</p>
                <img src="image/bleach.jpg" alt="Bleach">
                <li><strong><i>Mob Psycho 100:</i></strong></li>
                <p>on't let the title fool you. Mob Psycho 100 is another fun romp from original One-Punch Man creator
                    One.
                    The
                    series works as both a parody of shonen-style anime and a great example of it, revolving around an
                    eighth-grader named Mob, a quiet, reserved boy who specializes in exorcising evil spirits. The catch
                    is
                    that
                    his own supernatural powers are tied to his emotions. If he gets pushed over the edge, the entire
                    world
                    is
                    in peril. This series thrives on the strength of its humor, its small but memorable cast of
                    characters
                    and
                    its dynamic visual style. </p>

                <li><strong><i>Hunter x Hunte:</i></strong></li>
                <p>Hunter x Hunter (pronounced Hunter Hunter) starts out with a familiar trope: A hero, in this case a
                    young
                    boy
                    named Gon, leaves his small town for the first time on an adventure. He leaves the island on a quest
                    to
                    find
                    his long-forgotten father who had left him behind. His only clue? He‚Äôs a world-famous licensed
                    Hunter --
                    so
                    Gon sets off to take the notoriously deadly exam and become a Hunter himself. It sounds mundane and
                    almost
                    cheery, but Hunter x Hunter is anything but. The emotional highs and lows and the arcs of both the
                    protagonists and antagonists are some of the best. As with most shonen, the dramatic action is
                    fantastic,
                    too. </p>
                <img src="image/hunter-x-hunter.jpeg" alt="hunter-x-hunter">
                <li><strong><i>Attack on Titan</i></strong></li>
                <p>Attack on Titan (Japanese: ÈÄ≤ÊíÉ„ÅÆÂ∑®‰∫∫, Hepburn: Shingeki no Kyojin, lit.‚Äâ'The Advancing Giants') is a
                    Japanese
                    manga series written and illustrated by Hajime Isayama. It is set in a world where humanity is
                    forced to
                    live in cities surrounded by three enormous walls that protect them from gigantic man-eating
                    humanoids
                    referred to as Titans; the story follows Eren Yeager, who vows to exterminate the Titans after they
                    bring
                    about the destruction of his hometown and the death of his mother. Attack on Titan was serialized in
                    Kodansha's monthly sh≈çnen manga magazine Bessatsu Sh≈çnen Magazine from September 2009 to April 2021,
                    with
                    its chapters collected in 34 tank≈çbon volumes</p>

                <li><strong><i>Naruto Shippuden</i></strong></li>
                <p>The long-running Naruto series has been referred to as one of the ‚Äúbig three‚Äù anime because of its
                    wild
                    popularity around the world, and for good reason. It‚Äôs full of action-packed fight sequences,
                    hilariously
                    fun moments, and dramatic scenes that pull at your heartstrings. In Naruto Shippuden, the story
                    takes a
                    darker and more serious tone as the characters are now older and face even more daunting challenges
                    from
                    the
                    shadows as well as themselves. The Naruto anime series is known for its memorable characters and
                    relationships, and it continues to be one of the biggest shounen anime ever, even long after it has
                    ended.

                <li><strong><i>Death Note</i></strong></li>
                <p>Death Note (stylized in all caps) is a Japanese manga series written by Tsugumi Ohba and illustrated
                    by
                    Takeshi Obata. The story follows Light Yagami, a teen genius who discovers a mysterious notebook:
                    the
                    "Death
                    Note", which belonged to the shinigami Ryuk, and grants the user the supernatural ability to kill
                    anyone
                    whose name is written in its pages. The series centers around Light's subsequent attempts to use the
                    Death
                    Note to carry out a worldwide massacre of individuals whom he deems immoral and to create a
                    crime-free
                    society, using the alias of a god-like vigilante named "Kira", and the subsequent efforts of an
                    elite
                    Japanese police task force, led by enigmatic detective L, to apprehend him. Death Note ran in
                    Shueisha's
                    manga magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Jump from December 2003 to May 2006. Its 108 chapters were collected in
                    12
                    tank≈çbon volumes.</p>
